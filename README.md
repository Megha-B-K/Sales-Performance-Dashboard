## Key DAX Measures

```dax
Profit Margin =
DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)

YoY Sales Growth =
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales] - CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])),
    CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
)

Top N Sales =
TOPN(5, 'Sales', [Total Sales], DESC)

Avg Discount by Promotion =
AVERAGEX(
    VALUES('Sales'[Promotion Name]),
    CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Sales'[Discount %]))
)
```
